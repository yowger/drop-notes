            "description": "Using Axios for API calls can improve error handling by providing more detailed error messages and easier access to response data. Additionally, Axios has built-in support for interceptors, which can be used to globally handle errors or modify requests and responses. This can simplify your code and make it more maintainable. It's also a widely used library with good community support and regular updates, ensuring that it remains reliable and up-to-date. Integrating Axios into your project can lead to more robust and scalable API handling, enhancing the overall stability and performance of your application.",
